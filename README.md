# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  The provided code lacks proper handling for cases where a requested user ID does not exist, potentially resulting in application crashes or unexpected behavior.  A solution is provided to illustrate best practices for robust error handling.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches a user based on their ID.  If the user ID is invalid or does not exist, the code does not handle the error gracefully, resulting in an unhandled exception.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version of the route handler.  It includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where the user ID is invalid or the user is not found.  The solution ensures a more robust and reliable application by providing appropriate error responses to clients.
